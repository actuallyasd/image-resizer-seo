Birme.net: Has the feature that we are banking on. Their entire search volume is based on organic SEO. No paid ads at all (a feature we see across almost all competitors). The reliance on banklinks is huge, again a metric that is widely seen across all competitors. They have no blog, which gives us an opportunity to fill that gap. UI/UX is also quite basic, and the images that come out after focal point resizing are blurry and not up to the mark. However, this tool has been around for a while, for more than 12-13 years, and has been regularly updated with features. It seems to be a personal project rather than a commercial tool. 


https://redketchup.io/: Their main feature seems to be the Twitter video/gif download feature, because that is generating them an insane amount of traffic. So, rather than the image resizer generating the traffic volume, the majority of it is generated through the Twitter download feature. So it could be said that the Twitter download feature is their USP, and the other tools that they have act as byproducts. Comparatively, the traffic that their image resizer tool generates is minuscule in comparison to their total volume. 


https://www.simpleimageresizer.com: A straightforward tool that compresses, converts and resizes images, among other things. A thing noticeable about them is that they have certain articles/snippets that mention resizing images for certain needs (resize images for social media, or compress them for faster web loads, and also mention different needs for different agents, such as marketers, developers, real estate agents, etc.), which helps in their SEO.
